## What is computational thinking?
* "Computational thinking is a pattern of problem solving that involves organizing and analyzing data, abstracting in search of patterns, and breaking complex problems into discrete, solvable parts." [Jeannette Wing, 2006, doi: 10.1145/1118178.1118215](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1118178.1118215) 
* **Coding is an introduction to the structure of computers, text editors and their logic.**     
    * Learning to code will help build your conceptual knowledge of how programs work. This will facilitate collaboration.It will help you learn what questions to ask & help you learn what is possible.

    * ["Curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
