## What is computational thinking?
* "Computational thinking is a pattern of problem solving that involves organizing and analyzing data, abstracting in search of patterns, and breaking complex problems into discrete, solvable parts." [Jeannette Wing, 2006, doi: 10.1145/1118178.1118215](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1118178.1118215) 
* **Coding is an introduction to the structure of computers, text editors and their logic.**     
    * Introduces conceptualization/helps to understand directory structure. 
    * Helps understand how scripts work, so when you set up tools in the future, you can set them up to be useful for what you are trying to do. 
    * The goal is that when you are setting up environments in something like Rstudio (and it asks you about regrex), you can make informed choices about the settings.  
    * Asking questions and avoiding the curse of knowledge. 
    * ["Curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
    * How to build bridges, not walled gardens
