* "Computational thinking is a pattern of problem solving that involves organizing and analyzing data, abstracting in search of patterns, and breaking complex problems into discrete, solvable parts." [Jeannette Wing, 2006, doi: 10.1145/1118178.1118215](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1118178.1118215) 
* "It enables humanities researchers to formulate new questions and to think through how to leverage both data and computational processes to explore those questions. While these skills may be taught in the context of a particular programming language, in our case Python, the patterns of thought are transferable to any language or computational process."

* **To learn to code is learn about structure of computers, text editors and their logic.**     
    * Introduces conceptualization/helps to understand directory structure. 
    * Helps understand how scripts work, so when you set up tools in the future, you can set them up to be useful for what you are trying to do. 

    Getting started: learn how to use the command line, how to read technical documentation, use libraries, how to look up and resolve error messages,
 
* **Python** is one of the common languages used in DH, used for a wide range of tasks, including collecting and analyzing data in a variety of formats. We will go through how to get started in Python, using libraries and how you can continue to grow your skills after DHRI. 

## What is computational thinking?
* Command thinking (Intro. to Computer science, STS (Science and Technology Studies), etc.). We will be discussing this more when we discuss [coding.](https://southernmethodistuniversity.github.io/dhri/whycoding.html)
