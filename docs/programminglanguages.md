# Programming languages  

 Which language should you learn? 
 - Just as choosing which language you will use for your foreign language requirement is based on your research question, there are multiple programming languages you can choose to learn. 
 
 In data science and digital humanities, R and Python are the most common. Most 'introduction to a programming language' sessions will focus on one or the other. 

  * How much of the language do you need to learn? 
  * Does your project require basic fluency or only reading comprehension? 

## Python 
* [Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

## R 
* [R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
* Learning R fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the Internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.

## R vs. Python
<!--* [Comparing Python vs R Objectively.](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-vs-r/): “where Python is more object-oriented, and R is more functional.”

# Tutorials (online notebooks)
When you see language referring to *interactive tutorials* they are referring to online notebooks (such as [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) or [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)) that combine *executable code* and rich *text* in a single document. 

 These allow instructors to have text explanations alongside sections with executable code (code that you can run and modify to see how it works) in the same document. 

There is an introductory tutorial to 'Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks' available through [JSTOR Constellate](https://guides.smu.edu/c.php?g=1397994) Tutorials.
